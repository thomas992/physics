# Purpose

To be able to simulate gravity, regional meterology as it relates to a geographic position over time of day or night.

## Gravity

Gravity including the moon, or multiple moons, multiple suns. It should be able to simulate Pluto and Charon spinning.

### Meterology, tide

Wind patterns, mirroring live meterology data. Adjusting calculations to compensate for the actual speed below the surface water.
If the moon crashed into Earth and you were at the right spot, hypotethically one would see water rise up towards the moon before impact.

### Water in 3d

Calculating volume in a body of water and realisticly simulate water dispercement of a moving body in water.
Segmenting the water surface 3d planes with a level of detail first rendering allowing the program to increase resolution, level of detail.
