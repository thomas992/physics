# Purpose

To be able to simulate gravity, regional meterology as it relates to a geographic position over time of day or night.

## Gravity

Gravity including the moon, or multiple moons, multiple suns. It should be able to simulate Pluto and Charon spinning.

### Meterology, tide

Wind patterns, mirroring live meterology data. Adjusting calculations to compensate for the actual speed below the surface water.

watching this video I think it would be awesome in a 3d environment. (references to Majora's Mask at beginning)

### Water in 3d

Calculating volume in a body of water and realisticly simulate water dispercement of a moving body in water.
Segmenting the water surface 3d planes with a level of detail first rendering allowing the program to increase resolution, level of detail.
